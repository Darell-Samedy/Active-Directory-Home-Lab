# Active-Directory-Home-Lab

# Overview
This project demonstrates my hands-on experience setting up and managing an Active Directory (AD) environment in a virtualized home lab. I designed and deployed a simulated enterprise network with a domain controller, multiple client systems, and integrated security monitoring using Splunk.

Through this project, I strengthened my skills in Windows Server administration, Group Policy management, DNS/DHCP configuration, and user access control — key areas that align with IT Support, Systems Administration, and Cybersecurity roles.
